# DESCRIPTION

_Some bigots rolled into your town. Let's help them roll out!_

Handvaska! is an over-the-top, super-fast, physics-based FPS (First Purse-on Shooter). You have 15 seconds to smash as many bigots with your handbag as possible. Line up your swings, knock baddies into each other like bowling pins, and thwack your way to a 100% victory.

[WASD] or [arrow keys] to move, [mouse] to look, and [F] to swing your purse. 
The timer only starts once you make your first swing, so take your time lining up your first shot.

Handvaska! was made by Ramsey Nasser and Jane Friedhoff for GGJ17. They were inspired by the classic 1985 photo of [Danuta Danielsson beating the shit out of a neo-nazi with her purse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/A_Woman_Hitting_a_Neo-Nazi_With_Her_Handbag.jpg). 

The suggested donation is $3, all of which will go to CLEAR. (CLEAR is not affiliated with Handvaska!: they just do good work.)
